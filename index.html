        I am currently a researcher at the <strong>Performance and Adaptive Computing Systems (PACS) Lab</strong> at York University, 
        where I work on cutting-edge topics in <strong>Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong> and <strong>serverless computing platforms</strong>. 
        My research explores performance optimization, scalability, and intelligent resource management in modern AI-powered cloud systems.

        Prior to joining PACS Lab, I worked extensively in enterprise architecture and digital transformation initiatives, 
        particularly during my Masterâ€™s studies in Information Technology. I contributed to numerous large-scale national 
        projects in domains such as smart government, software integration, process reengineering, and enterprise IT strategy.
